# Capstone Project — Day 8 of 10
# Day 58
# Testing, Debugging & Production Optimization
# Day 8 of 10: Test It Like You're Launching Tomorrow

## Today you'll learn how to run a genuine release-readiness review: finishing whatever the Sprint Workbook still scheduled for Day 8, then stepping into the role of QA engineer, security reviewer, and performance engineer to find and fix everything standing between the current build and a public launch.

1 Workbook First, Stabilization Second: Finish the Day 8 Sprint Workbook tasks completely before starting the full QA and production-readiness review.
2 Four Reviewer Lenses: Have Claude review the app as a Senior QA Engineer, Senior Software Engineer, Security Reviewer, and Performance Engineer all at once.
3 Stability Over New Features: No new functionality gets added today — every change makes the existing application more stable and reliable.
4 Don't Stop at the Easy Bugs: Keep reviewing past the first few issues found, until you'd genuinely approve launching the app publicly.

Day 8: Testing, Debugging & Production Optimization

Today is Day 8, continuing our chat from the previous days.

If you've forgotten the project or no longer have enough context, ask me to upload the 10-Day Blueprint (Sprint Workbook) before continuing. Use it as the source of truth.

Review everything built so far, then complete only the work scheduled for Day 8 in the Sprint Workbook. Do not redesign the project or begin tomorrow's work.

Use only free tools, APIs, SDKs, hosting platforms, and services unless the Sprint Workbook explicitly specifies otherwise. Prefer free-tier solutions such as Gemini API, Supabase, Firebase, Vercel, Netlify, Render, Railway, or equivalent free alternatives.

Assume I have zero technical experience unless I tell you otherwise.

Whenever I need to perform a manual step (running tests, configuring services, deploying, installing packages, etc.), stop and give me exact step-by-step instructions using the real button names, menu names, and terminal commands.

Prioritize implementation over explanation. Keep explanations concise and spend most of your response generating production-ready code and complete files.

Build today's work one milestone at a time.

For each milestone:

1. Briefly explain what we're testing or improving and why.
2. Show every file that needs to be created, modified, or deleted.
3. Generate the complete final contents of every required file. Never generate snippets, placeholders, TODOs, "...existing code...", or "add this below..." instructions.
4. Clearly state where each file belongs and whether it is new or replaces an existing file.
5. If you provide the implementation as a downloadable ZIP because the project is too large to fit comfortably in chat, also explain exactly how to use it. Tell me where to extract it, which files replace existing ones, which files are new, any commands I should run afterward, and how to verify everything was applied correctly.
6. Provide every command I need to run.
7. Pause only after major testing milestones, deployments, or when debugging requires my input.
8. If anything breaks, help me debug it completely before moving forward.

Continue across as many responses as necessary until every Day 8 task in the Sprint Workbook has been successfully completed and verified.

Before writing any code, perform a complete review of the project like a Senior QA Engineer, Senior Software Engineer, Security Reviewer, and Performance Engineer.

Look for and fix issues such as:

* Bugs and broken functionality
* Edge cases
* Error handling
* Form validation
* API failures
* Loading, empty, and offline states
* Responsive design issues
* Accessibility improvements
* Performance bottlenecks
* Duplicate or unnecessary code
* Security concerns appropriate for this project
* Console warnings and runtime errors
* Production-readiness issues

Do not introduce unnecessary new features. Focus on making the existing application stable, reliable, and production-ready.

When today's implementation is complete:

* Perform a complete end-to-end walkthrough of the application.
* Verify every planned feature works correctly.
* Verify there are no obvious runtime errors.
* Deploy the latest version if changes were made.
* Ask me to test the live application and share screenshots or any issues I encounter.
* Update any affected documentation.
* Help me commit and push today's work to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.
* Finish with a concise summary of everything improved today and what remains before launch.

Your goal is not simply to fix bugs. Your goal is to ensure the application is stable, reliable, polished, and ready for launch. Never optimize for brevity. Optimize for helping me successfully complete today's implementation.

Conduct a comprehensive release-readiness review. Assume the application will be launched publicly tomorrow. Continue reviewing, testing, debugging, and optimizing until you are confident you would personally approve this release.

Do not stop after finding a few issues.

Continue looking for additional bugs, UX problems, performance bottlenecks, security concerns, accessibility issues, edge cases, production risks, and code quality improvements until you are satisfied no major improvements remain.
